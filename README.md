# CANBUS-Schedule

A project that was intended as an STM32 implementation for the task of CAN bus message scheduling, to synchronize master and slave node timers in a CAN bus network, and allow the realization of a deterministic message schedule for time-critical applications.

The files for later changes about the addition of a second slave node, refined timer values, and a primitive implementation for drift correction are lost. Currently, this project is abandoned.
